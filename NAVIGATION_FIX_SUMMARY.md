# 🚨 CRITICAL NAVIGATION FIX - USER ENTRAPMENT RESOLVED

## ❌ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

Users accessing `http://localhost:5210/register?requirePayment=true` were **trapped** in the payment flow with no way to return to the main splash screen or browse other plans. This was a critical UX issue.

## ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

- **Back Button**: Context-aware navigation (payment vs normal flow)
- **Change Plan Option**: Prominent button in payment flow
- **Info Alert**: Clear messaging about browsing plans

### 3. **Smart Routing Updates**
- **Root Route (`/`)**: Smart redirect based on auth state
- **Plans Route (`/plans`)**: Always accessible for plan selection
- **Escape Routes**: Multiple ways to exit payment flows
