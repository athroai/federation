## **📊 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Database Schema**
```sql
-- User tiers table
CREATE TABLE user_tiers (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  tier TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (tier IN ('lite', 'full')),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Profiles table (extended)
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN user_tier TEXT DEFAULT 'lite';
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN stripe_customer_id TEXT;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN stripe_subscription_id TEXT;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN subscription_status TEXT DEFAULT 'inactive';

-- Monitoring tables
CREATE TABLE error_logs (...);
CREATE TABLE analytics_events (...);
CREATE TABLE health_check_logs (...);
```

### **Component Architecture**
```
