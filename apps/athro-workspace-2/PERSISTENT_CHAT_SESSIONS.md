# Persistent Chat Sessions

## Overview

The chat interface now supports persistent chat sessions per Athro. This means that chat conversations will remain in place across:
- Page refreshes
- Logout/login cycles
- Browser restarts

## How It Works

### Session Management
- Each Athro has its own persistent chat session stored in localStorage
- Sessions are automatically saved as you chat
- Sessions persist until explicitly saved or deleted

### Session Actions

#### Save Session
- **Button**: üíæ Save Session
- **Action**: Archives the current session and starts a new one
- **Result**: Current conversation is saved and a fresh welcome message appears
- **Use Case**: When you want to keep a conversation but start fresh

#### Delete Session
- **Button**: üóëÔ∏è Delete Session  
- **Action**: Permanently deletes the current session and starts a new one
- **Result**: Current conversation is lost and a fresh welcome message appears
- **Use Case**: When you want to completely start over

### Session Information
The interface shows:
- Session ID (first 8 characters)
- Creation date
- Number of messages
- Last updated time

### Technical Implementation

#### ChatSessionService
- `saveActiveSession()`: Saves current messages to localStorage
- `getActiveSession()`: Retrieves the active session for an Athro
- `archiveAndCreateNewSession()`: Archives current session and creates new one
- `deleteAndCreateNewSession()`: Deletes current session and creates new one
- `getArchivedSessions()`: Gets all archived sessions for an Athro
- `loadArchivedSession()`: Loads an archived session as active

#### Storage Structure
- Active sessions: `athro_chat_session_{athroId}`
- Archived sessions: `athro_chat_session_{athroId}_archived_{sessionId}`

### Benefits
1. **Continuity**: Never lose your conversation progress
2. **Flexibility**: Choose when to save or start fresh
3. **Organization**: Keep multiple sessions per Athro
4. **Reliability**: Works across browser sessions and page refreshes

### Usage Examples

#### Scenario 1: Long Study Session
1. Start chatting with an Athro
2. Have a long conversation about a topic
3. When done, click "Save Session" to archive it
4. Start a new session for the next topic

#### Scenario 2: Quick Question
1. Ask a quick question
2. Get your answer
3. Click "Delete Session" to start fresh for next time

#### Scenario 3: Page Refresh
1. Have a conversation
2. Refresh the page or close/reopen browser
3. Return to the same Athro
4. Your conversation is exactly where you left off
