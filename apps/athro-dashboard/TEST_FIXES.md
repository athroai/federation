# Critical Data Persistence Fixes - Test Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ "Session not found" Error (FIXED ✅)
**Problem**: When pressing "Clear All Data" in debug panel, the page would reload with `window.location.reload()`, breaking any active sessions in embedded workspace components.

**Fix**: Replaced `window.location.reload()` with safer event-driven refresh mechanism.

**Test**: 
1. Open Dashboard with debug panel
2. Press "Clear All Data" 
3. Confirm you see warning dialog
4. Should NOT see "Session not found" errors
5. Dashboard should refresh properly without page reload

### 2. ❌ Manual Selections Not Persisting (FIXED ✅)
**Problem**: Dashboard initialization was calling `athroSelectionService.toggleSelection()` for already-selected athros, accidentally turning them OFF!

**Fix**: Added checks to only toggle if not already selected:
```typescript
// BEFORE (buggy):
selectedAthroIds.forEach(athroId => {
  athroSelectionService.toggleSelection('athro-dashboard', athroId);
});

// AFTER (fixed):
selectedAthroIds.forEach(athroId => {
  if (!athroSelectionService.isSelected('athro-dashboard', athroId)) {
    console.log('🔧 Adding selection for:', athroId);
    athroSelectionService.toggleSelection('athro-dashboard', athroId);
  } else {
    console.log('✅ Already selected in service:', athroId);
  }
});
```

**Test**:
1. Use debug panel "Test Manual Selection" button
2. Check console logs - should see detailed selection tracking
3. Manual selections should now persist properly
4. No more accidental toggling off of existing selections

### 3. ❌ "2 selected but not ones that i made" (FIXED ✅)
**Problem**: Old/stale selections were persisting while new manual selections were being toggled off by the initialization bug.

**Fix**: Same as #2 above - proper initialization prevents overriding manual selections.

**Test**:
1. Make manual selections via the dashboard settings
2. Reload the page
3. Your manual selections should persist
4. Should not see random old selections taking precedence

## Testing Instructions

### Quick Test (2 minutes)
1. Open Dashboard: `npm run dev` in `athro-dashboard/`
2. Make some athro selections in the settings panel
3. Reload the page
4. Verify selections persist

### Detailed Test (5 minutes)
1. Open Dashboard with debug panel visible (top-right corner)
2. Click "Test Manual Selection" - watch console logs
3. Should see successful storage creation
4. Try "Clear All Data" - should NOT reload page
5. Check storage debugging info in debug panel

### Cross-App Test (Advanced)
1. Select athros in dashboard settings
2. Open workspace in embedded mode
3. Selections should be available in workspace
4. No session errors when clearing debug data

## Debug Console Commands

Open browser console and run:

```javascript
// Check current selections
console.log('Current selections:', athroSelectionService.getSelections('athro-dashboard'));

// Check storage keys
console.log('Storage keys:', Object.keys(localStorage).filter(k => k.includes('athro')));

// Test manual toggle
console.log('Before:', athroSelectionService.isSelected('athro-dashboard', 'athro-maths'));
athroSelectionService.toggleSelection('athro-dashboard', 'athro-maths');
console.log('After:', athroSelectionService.isSelected('athro-dashboard', 'athro-maths'));
```

## Expected Console Logs (Success)

When working correctly, you should see:
- `✅ Already selected in service: athro-maths` (during initialization)
- `🔧 Adding selection for: athro-english` (when adding new selections)
- `🔄 Data cleared, notifying parent components to refresh...` (when clearing data)
- NO `Session not found` errors

## Key Files Modified
- `athro-dashboard/src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx` - Fixed initialization bug
- `athro-dashboard/src/components/Dashboard/DebugPanel.tsx` - Enhanced debugging + safe reset
- Added storage event listeners for real-time updates
