# Testing Confidence Levels & Calendar Events Persistence

## 🔧 Debug Mode Active
Enhanced logging is now active. Check browser console for:

### Confidence Level Testing
1. **Open browser console** (F12)
2. **Click on athro Settings** (last card)
3. **Move a confidence slider** - you should see:
   ```
   🎯 Slider changed for [Athro Name] from [old] to [new]
   💪 handleConfidenceChange called: {athroName: "...", athroId: "...", newLevel: X, user: true}
   🔧 Updating local state for athro: ... to level: X
   🔧 Local confidence state updated: {...}
   💪 Saving confidence levels to Supabase: {...}
   ✅ Confidence levels saved successfully
   ```
4. **Refresh the page**
5. **Check if confidence levels persist** - you should see:
   ```
   💪 Setting confidence levels from Supabase: {...}
   ```

### Calendar Events Testing
1. **Click on Timekeeper card** (2nd card)
2. **Create a calendar event** by clicking on a time slot
3. **Check console for**:
   ```
   📅 Saving calendar events after user interaction
   Saving calendar events for user: [userId] Events count: 1
   Successfully saved calendar events to Supabase
   ```
4. **Refresh the page**
5. **Check if calendar events persist** - you should see:
   ```
   Loading calendar events for user: [userId]
   Loaded calendar events from Supabase: [...]
   Successfully converted events: [...]
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### If Confidence Levels Don't Work:
- Check if you see "❌ No user authenticated" - means you need to log in
- Check if you see the "💪 handleConfidenceChange called" message
- Look for any error messages with "❌ Failed to save confidence levels"

### If Calendar Events Don't Work:
- Check if you see "📅 Saving calendar events after user interaction"
- Look for "Failed to save calendar events" errors
- Verify the events are being created (check events count in console)

## Expected Behavior
- ✅ **Confidence sliders** should move smoothly and update in real-time
- ✅ **Calendar events** should appear immediately when created
- ✅ **Page refresh** should restore all confidence levels and calendar events
- ✅ **Console logs** should show successful save/load operations
